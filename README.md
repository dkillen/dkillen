Hi, I’m David Killen - I'm a blockchain engineer and recovering commercial and intellectual property lawyer.
- I started my career as a software engineer almost 25 years ago, took a diversion into legal practice, and have come back to doing what I really love, building software.
- Formerly a Senior Blockchain Engineer @ ConsenSys (Tuffle), I'm now looking for my next challenge.
- My main interests lay in blockchain and web3 - Ethereum and [StarkNet](https://starknet.io/) in particular.
- I've spent the last 12 months or so immersed in the StarkNet ecosystem, getting to know the network and its tech stack, learning to write Cairo smart contracts, and researching to build tools to improve the lives of StarkNet developers. I've been privileged to meet and collaborate with a lot of smart, really cool people in the StarkNet ecosystem and I'm looking forward to meeting and working with many more. 
- I'm a lifelong learner and curious about a whole range of subjects. I’m always actively learning more about those things that interest me. Right now, that means building on StarkNet and Ethereum.
- I’m always happy to hear about interesting web3 projects, especially if they're on StarkNet. So, don't be a stranger. Please say hi.
- How do you reach me? The easiest way is probably to DM my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DavidAKillen)
