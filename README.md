Hi, I’m David Killen - I'm a blockchain engineer and recovering commercial and intellectual property lawyer.
- I started my career as a software engineer almost 25 years ago, took a diversion into legal practice, and have come back to doing what I really love, building software.
- Senior BLockchain Engineer @ Trust Wallet - formerly a Senior Blockchain Engineer @ ConsenSys (Tuffle).
- My main interests lie in blockchain and web3 - Ethereum and StarkNet in particular.
- I'm a lifelong learner and curious about a whole range of subjects. I’m always actively learning more about those things that interest me. Right now, that means building on StarkNet and Ethereum.
- I’m always happy to hear about interesting web3 projects, especially if they're on StarkNet. So, don't be a stranger. Please say hi.
- How do you reach me? The easiest way is probably to DM my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DavidAKillen)
