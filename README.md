- 👋 Hi, I’m David Killen - @dkillen
- 👀 I’m interested in blockchain development (DeFi and NFTs in particular) and full stack web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about blockchain development on Ethereum and polishing up my full stack skills in Angular, React, Web3, and MongoDB.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything DeFi and NFT related. I'm developing a couple of my own ideas applying DeFi and NFTs to gaming and property investment.
